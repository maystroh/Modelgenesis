## Forked from
We used implementation proposed by this [link] (https://github.com/MrGiovanni/ModelsGenesis). They have built a set of pre-trained models called <b>Generic Autodidactic Models</b>, nicknamed <b>Models Genesis</b>, because they are created <i>ex nihilo</i> (with no manual labeling), self-taught (learned by self-supervision), and generic (served as source models for generating application-specific target models). We envision that Models Genesis may serve as a primary source of transfer learning for 3D medical imaging applications, in particular, with limited annotated data. 

In this project, we have tried to apply the self-supervised techniques on our own OCT dataset. Please check the file `Genesis_OCT.py`
